# OIBSIP_Temperature-Converter
Designing a user interface that facilitates temperature conversion entails the incorporation of four primary components:

Input Field:

Provide a designated area where users can input their temperature values.
Implement validation mechanisms to ensure that entered values are numerical.
Unit Selection:

Integrate either a dropdown menu or radio buttons, allowing users to specify the unit of the provided temperature input (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
Conversion Trigger:

Include a clearly labeled "Convert" button, serving as the trigger for the temperature conversion process.
Display Area:

Allocate a dedicated space for presenting the converted temperature along with its corresponding unit.
By adhering to these design considerations, the user experience will be streamlined, offering a seamless and intuitive interface for temperature conversion.
